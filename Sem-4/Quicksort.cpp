//* elements smaller than pivot are on the left side of the array
//* elements larger than pivot are on the right side of the array
//* after every pass you are putting the pivot in its correct position
//* and then you are recursively calling the function on the left and right side of the pivot
//* Time Complexity: O(n^2)
//* Space Complexity: O(1)
